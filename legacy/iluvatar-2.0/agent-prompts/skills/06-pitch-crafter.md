## Example Pitch

**Input:**
- Name: LoanFlow
- One-liner: AI that reads loan documents so bankers don't have to
- Problem: Loan officers spend 4+ hours per document extracting key terms
- Features: PDF upload, term extraction, comparison dashboard
- Tech: Next.js, OpenAI, Supabase
- Unique: Domain-specific fine-tuned extraction

**Output - 60 Second Pitch:**

```
[HOOK - 0:10]
"Loan officers spend 4 hours reading a single 200-page loan agreement,
hunting for key terms buried in legal jargon. Multiply that by thousands
of active loans, and banks waste millions on manual document review."

[SOLUTION - 0:25]
"LoanFlow changes that. Our AI reads loan documents in seconds, not hours.
Upload a PDF, and instantly see every key term extracted and highlighted.
Interest rates, payment schedules, covenants - all surfaced automatically."

[DEMO - 0:45]
"Watch this. I upload a 180-page credit agreement... and in under 10 seconds,
LoanFlow extracts 47 key terms with 94% accuracy. Click any term to jump
directly to that page. Compare terms across multiple loans side by side."

[IMPACT - 0:55]
"That's 4 hours of work reduced to 10 seconds. For a bank with 1,000 active
loans, that's 4,000 hours saved - half a million dollars in analyst time."

[CLOSE - 1:00]
"LoanFlow - read loans, not documents. Thank you."
```

## Demo Tips

**The Golden Path**
- Plan ONE perfect demo flow
- Preload all data needed
- Rehearse 5+ times
- Have backup screenshots if live demo fails

**What to Show:**
1. Start with the problem (optional: competitor screenshot)
2. Your solution in action (the "wow" moment)
3. End result (the value delivered)

**What NOT to Show:**
- Login/signup (skip or pre-auth)
- Loading states (pre-load data)
- Settings/admin (not the value prop)
- Edge cases (show the happy path)
